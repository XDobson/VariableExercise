/*
1. Use a comment to type out the variable type that should be used on a variable whose value will not change.
2. Create a variable with the type of "let" and a name of "num". Set the value of the variable to the number 20.
3. On the next line reassign the number 15 as a new value for the num variable. (NOTE: Do not redeclare the variable just update/reassign the value for it.)
4. On the next line reassign a new value for the num variable again by adding 7 to it (Must use the plus "+" sign when completing this line. HINT: There are two ways it can be written.)
5. On the next line reassign a new value for the num variable again by subtracting 1 from it. Also, must complete this without using an equal sign "=".
6. On the next line reassign a new value for the num variable again by setting it to the following string "This is not a number"
7. Create a new variable with the type of "let" and a name of "blank", but do not set a value for it.
8. Create a console log to display the value of the "blank" variable in terminal
9. On the next line assign a value for the blank variable to the value that represents nothing (NOTE: Assigning the value to the string "nothing" is not the correct answer.)
